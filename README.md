# Sexually antagonistic variation and the evolution of dimorphic sexual systems 

## Overview

This is the GitHub repository for the development of a population genetics theory project about the evolution of dioecy and incipient sex chromosomes. Citing information for the resulting paper will be provided when it is made [available through the publisher](http://XXXXX). You can also contact me directly if you would like a reprint. Here you can find all of the necessary code to reproduce the analyses and the pre-publication manuscript. The *Mathematica* `.nb` files where the models are developed are not tracked by git, but can be downloaded as an online appendix from the publisher website above (or contact me and I will be happy to provide if you don't have access to the appendices). Aside from the `.nb` files, all necessary code for creating the figures can be found in the `./R/functions-*.R` files. 


## Citing information

Olito, C. and Connallon, T. 2019. Sexually antagonistic variation and the evolution of dimorphic sexual systems. *The American Naturalist* doi:10.1086/XXXXXX

DOI and volume/page no. info will be updated when made available by the publisher.


## Reproducing the manuscript

The easiest way to reproduce the manuscript is to simply clone the repo, run `createFigs.R`, and then compile the manuscript file `doc/dioecySA.tex` using whatever default LaTeX editor/engine you have. To reproduce the simulations etc., you will need to create the  run the R scripts `recSim-*-RunSims.R`


## Contact & bug reporting

Please report any bugs, problems, or issues by opening an issue on the dioecySA github [issues page](https://github.com/colin-olito/dioecySA/issues). If you would like to report a bug/issue, and do not have a github account (and don't want to get one), please send a brief email detailing the problem you encountered to colin.olito at monash dot edu.
